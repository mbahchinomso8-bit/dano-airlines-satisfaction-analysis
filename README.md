# dano-airlines-satisfaction-analysis
Power BI dashboard and analysis of 120,000+ airline passenger satisfaction records.
Project Overview
This project analyzes customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers. The dataset covers passenger demographics, travel details, service quality ratings and flight delays. The aim is to discover what drives satisfaction and dissatisfaction, and to provide data-driven recommendations for Dano Airlines.
The analysis was done using Power BI with supporting data cleaning in Power Query and calculations in DAX. 
A single-page dashboard was built to show the following:
Overall satisfaction rate** and passenger volume.
- Who is unhappy: by Class, Customer Type, Travel Type.
- Cause of unhappiness: low-rated services, delays, seat comfort.
- Impact of delays on satisfaction: sharp drop after 15 minutes.

**Economy & Eco Plus travelers** are the least satisfied.
**Disloyal customers** and **personal travel** passengers report lower scores.
**Top weak points**: arrival delays, seat comfort, food, and inflight wifi.
